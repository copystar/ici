ici
===

ici (French for here) is an HTML/JavaScript app for displaying Wikipedia 
articles that are relevant for your current location. Articles with a red
marker need an image, which you should now be able to easily upload
from your mobile device, since Wikipedia has streamlined the process. 
Articles with orange markers are in need of some kind of copy-editing or
additional citations.

ici uses a JavaScript library called [wikigeo.js](http://github.com/edsu/wikigeo) to get geojson out of the Wikipedia API, which it then adds to a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) map with tiles from [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org).
