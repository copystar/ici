ici (French for here) is an HTML/JavaScript app for displaying Wikipedia 
articles that are relevant for your current location. Articles with a pink
background need an image, which you should now be able to easily upload
from your mobile device, since Wikipedia has streamlined the process.

If you are on the go the list should refresh every minute, adding newly
discovered articles to the top of the list. Especially fun while you are
on a bus/train :-D
